     he      was     eating     watermelons      in        chicago

	  
1.2 What types of sentences will it fail to parse?

	Failure 1: he was eating watermelons in the earth
		-Reason: Grammar did not include a determiner as a part of prepositional phrase. Only pp recognizable is pp -> fp np.
		-Example:
			in	 the	 jetcar
			------np--------
			fp	  ----np---
			fp	 fd      nbar //Fail! The grammar doesn't have nbar -> fname
			fp	 fd		 fname	 

	Failure 2: she drives to steal the jetcar
		- Reason: infinitives are not recognized by the grammar.
		- Example:
			to steal
			 -vbar- // Fail! The grammar doesn't have vbar -> fp fv
			fp   fv


	Failure 3: i will have the jetcar
		- Reason: have/be words not included in grammar
		- Example: 
			will have
			faux  fv //Fail! Not define fv -> have


	Failure 4: steal the jetcar
		-Reason: There are no sentences that start with a verb in the given grammar.
		-Example: 
			steal the jetcar
			------s--------
			vp     ---np--- //Fail! With our grammar a sentence can't start with vp. s -> vp np


	Failure 5: I steal and live 
		-Reason: conjuctions not included in grammar
		-Example: 
			steal and live 
			vp    fcnj  vp // Fail! There are any conjunction.    


1.3 What improvements to the grammar or parser are required to properly parse common failed sentences?

	1. Add name in the nbar so we can have a preposition with a name.
		PP -> FP NP
		NP -> NBAR
		NBAR -> FNAME //Insert

	2. Insert the infinitives in the verbs
		FV -> to
		VP -> FV S
		S -> VP VP
	    Example: I want to swim 	

	3. Add the verbs have and be, verbs very common in English
		FV -> have
		FV -> be

	4. Insert sentence that start with a verb.
		S -> VP NP

	5. Insert the most important conjunctions, also add the combinations as sentence conjunctions sentence....
		S -> S FCNJ S
		NP -> NP FCNJ NP
		VP -> VP FCNJ VP 
		FCNJ -> AND, BUT, OR, SO
